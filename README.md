# Fake News Prediction Model
This python-based project is useful for predicting whether particular news is fake or not. I have used Logistic Regression Model for the project. Various python libraries have been used by me like NumPy, Pandas, TfidVectorizer and many more. The dataset I used has been made from thousands of news articles. The final dataset has columns such as title, text and label for each id. I have taken the ratio of 80:20 for training and testing data. After the model has been trained on the training data when it was again tested on the training data itself, it gave an accuracy of around 98%  and then when tested on the testing data, it gave me an accuracy of around 96%. The accuracy of the model I got was highly impressive. In near future, Iâ€™d like to build a similar model which can be used for a different kind of dataset.
